            	<p class="bio">I'm an interaction designer living in Pittsburgh while I pursue a <a href="http://design.cmu.edu/content/master-design" target="_blank">Master of Design (MDes) in Design for Interactions at Carnegie Mellon</a>. I'm interested in designing experiences that balance between functional usability and aesthetic playfulness. I try to keep in mind that pointing out the problem is the easy part, finding a useful solution is the challenge.</p>
