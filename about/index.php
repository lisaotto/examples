            	<p class="bio">I'm an interaction designer living in Pittsburgh while I pursue a <a href="http://design.cmu.edu/content/master-design" target="_blank">Master of Design (MDes) in Design for Interactions at Carnegie Mellon</a>. I love finding ways to take bureaucratic systems and make them friendly and accessible. I'm interested in service-oriented businesses, especially how technological processes can be configured to provide clear directives and proper nudges. </p>
