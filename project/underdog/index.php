        <p class="description">NCTA was looking to integrate the external blog into the recently redesigned website. The NCTA blog covers a wide range of topics from the latest Internet technology to television programming, so the blog had to remain a place where all of the topics could come together cohesively. Part of the challenge was maintaining the structure and theme of the current site while giving the blog a distinct feel.</p>

            <p class="onecolumn">Higher fidelity wireframes were created in Illustrator to map out and test the elements of the interface. For example, in early wireframes reaching the profile screen quickly was always a part of the flow but users were only given a gimpse of their profile through a transparent background. After considering the what users saw as a key benefit of Underdog -- simple to get started -- we wanted to give users a better sense of accomplishment after filling out the intial form.  </p>
